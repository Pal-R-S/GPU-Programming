Programming in CUDA

This repo takes you through my journey in CUDA programming
DEaling with Concurrencies, harnessing Parallelism and a lot more. 
Join me on this thrilling journey,

Here is a guide on navigating through this repo:
The Root contains many folders each consisting of various CUDA programs. `help.cu` in the root file is used in all the programs.
An easy way to execute programs is thus to move the program and its dependancies to the root directory, update the makefile to include any extra dependancies and run the makefile.
If proceeding as above dont forget to name the source file as main.cu
